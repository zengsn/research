*** Code of ProCRC classifier (ProCRC_code_ver_1.0)
"A Probabilistic Collaborative Representation based Approach for Pattern Classification"
 by Sijia Cai, Lei Zhang, Wangmeng Zuo and Xiangchu Feng, to appear in CVPR 2016.

*** Modes
-run demo_fr.m to start robust face recognition demo by robust ProCRC;
-run demo_ic.m to start image classification demo by ProCRC.

*** Features
If you need the features of Stanford 40 Actions, Caltech-UCSD Birds, Oxford 102 Flowers and Caltech-256 datasets to run the image classification demo, please contact me.
Or you can extract the CNN features of your own dataset and save the data as the following format:

-tr_descr: the descriptors of training set, each coloum refers to one training image;
-tr_label: the ground truth labels for training set;
-tr_descr: the descriptors of testing set, each coloum refers to one testing image;
-tr_label: the ground truth labels for testing set;
